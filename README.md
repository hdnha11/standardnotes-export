# Standard Notes Markdown Export

A simple tool to help migrate from Standard Notes backup files to other Markdown-based note-taking apps like Obsidian.

This tool takes a straightforward approach - keeping all note files flattened, with the file name being the note's title followed by `.md`.

It also retains the original tags from each note by adding a front matter section to the top of the file if tags exist.
